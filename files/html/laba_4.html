        <p class="stext">The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets
            of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. IP has the task of
            delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in the
            packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It
            also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

        <h2 class="mheader">More info </h2>
        <p class="stext">User Datagram Protocol (UDP) refers to a protocol used for communication throughout the
            internet. It is specifically chosen for time-sensitive applications like gaming, playing videos, or Domain
            Name System (DNS) lookups. UDP is frequently used when communications are time-sensitive. For users, it is
            better to have the overall transmission arrive on time than wait for it to get there in a near-perfect
            state. For this reason, UDP is commonly used in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications as well.

            For the listener, hearing what the speaker said relatively soon after it was spoken is preferable to waiting
            several seconds for crystal-clear speech. Similarly, with online gaming, experiencing less-than-ideal video
            or sound for a few moments is preferable to waiting for a clear transmission and risking losing the game in
            the interim.</p>
